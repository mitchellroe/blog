# Insert special characters in vim

To insert special characters in vim, while in insert mode, use `<Ctrl+k>`,
followed by a two-character code. Some examples include:

- `oo` • (bullet)
- `PR` ▶ (black right-pointing triangle)
- `Tr` ▷ (white right-pointing triangle)
- `Db` ◆ (diamond bullet)
- `'%` ϴ (Greek theta)
- `Pd` £ (British pound symbols)
- `Co` © (copyright symbol)
- `Rg` ® (registered trademark symbol)
- `Eu` € (euro symbol)
- `-1` ‐ (hyphen)
- `-N` – (en dash)
- `-M` — (em dash)

Check out `:help digraph` for more information. There is also the `:dig`
command.
