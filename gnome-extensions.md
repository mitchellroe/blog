# My Favorite GNOME Extensions

## Featured Extension

My favorite GNOME extension is, by far,
[Material Shell](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3357/material-shell/) by
[PapyElGringo](https://extensions.gnome.org/accounts/profile/PapyElGringo).
This extension is (in my opinion) less of an extension and more of a desktop
environment. Check out https://material-shell.com/ for more details.
