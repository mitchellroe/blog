# Screen Sharing in Wayland

You can enable the experimental PipeWire support in Google Chrome [based]
browsers, which will allow you to do full-screen sharing under Wayland. Go to
[chrome://flags/#enable-webrtc-pipewire-capturer](chrome://flags/#enable-webrtc-pipewire-capturer)
and enable the flag.
