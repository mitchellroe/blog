# Indigo Sparke - Colourblind

I heard this on an NPR Tiny Desk Concert podcast.

> There's a distance in our words<br>
> There's a distance in it hurts, and<br>
> All the king's horses and all the king's men<br>
> Well couldn't, no, they couldn't, put him back together again<br>
> So wait<br>
> Yeah, so wait
>
> There's a knowing in your eyes<br>
> There's a truth behind my lies, and<br>
> All the planets all born in a row<br>
> And nothing, not our star signs can show us what our future holds<br>
> So wait<br>
> Yeah, so wait
>
> Been waking with bad dreams<br>
> Been walking with shaking knees, and<br>
> I feel colorblind when I ain't with you<br>
> And there's no remedy for my shade of blue<br>
> So wait<br>
> Yeah, so wait
