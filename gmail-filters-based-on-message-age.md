# Gmail filters based on message age

I go through my documents and regularly clean out anything older than seven
years. This includes emails.

Gmail's search functionality makes this relatively easy:

```
older_than:7y
```

| Keyword       | Example Usage       |
|---------------|---------------------|
| `after:`      | `after:2004/04/16`  |
| `before:`     | `before:2004/04/18` |
| `older:`      | `older:2004/04/18`  |
| `newer:`      | `newer:2004/04/19`  |
| `older_than:` | `older_than:2d`     |
| `newer_than:` | `newer_than:4w`     |
